# Spotify API w/ React Application Template

This application was created as a starting point for developers wanting to use the Spotify API for a personal project or want to become more familiar with using APIs in general.

To use this application:
  1. Fork this repository and clone it to your machine.
  2. From your terminal in the directory of your cloned repository, run 'npm install'
    - This will initialize the 'node_modules' directory and install all dependencies.
  3. From the same terminal, in the same directory, run 'npm start'
  4. Have tons of fun!
